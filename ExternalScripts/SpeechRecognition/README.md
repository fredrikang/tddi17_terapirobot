# Python implementation of Google Speech To Text
Implementation in python using PyAudio and google.cloud to record and recognize speech.

The ```main.py``` is just a file for testing.

The recognition supports either synchronous (create an audio file and send it for recognition) or asynchronous (stream audio for direct recognition).
