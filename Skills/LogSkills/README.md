# Skills for exporting logs
The skills named ```ExportLogs_...``` all export logs via network as explained in the manual.

Note that none of the exporting skills remove any of the logs from the furhat memory when read.
To remove the logs use the ```RemoveLogs_All.skill``` to clear the log memory of the furhat robot.
